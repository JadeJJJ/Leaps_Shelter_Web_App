                    Who are we?</div><br />
                    LEAPS ( established 2008) is a registered, non-profit animal welfare organisation. We are dedicated to helping animals in need in the areas of Elands Bay, Lamberts Bay and Vredenburg up the West Coast, 220 km&nbsp;from Cape Town.<br />                
                    <br />
                    Our goal is to help animals in need. Our purpose is to make sure all animals have a home and a family that will love and care for them and make them feel safe, valued, healthy and loved.&nbsp;<br />
                        
                    <div class="auto-style78">
                        
                                          
                     Educating township pet owners to better care for their pets
                        </div>
                    <br />
                     Education is key to ensure the wellbeing of township animals. We provide this education as well as medical assistance, particularly with regard to mass sterilisations, vaccinations, feeding programmes and providing shelter to hundreds of animals. We also provide food on an ongoing basis to those who cannot afford to feed their pets.<br />

                     Rescue, rehabilitate and rehome unwanted and/or homeless animals.<br />
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    We are a foster-based organisation and have no shelter. That means we need volunteers to care for any unwanted animals while we find a suitable home for them. Before placing animals in foster care, we ensure the animal has received any vet care they may need (incl. vaccinations and sterilisation) and the foster family has been screened accordingly. Once a potential new family has completed the adoption process, the animal moves on to his/her forever home.<br />

                    Our Team<br /></div>
                    <br />

                     Our team consists of 4 dedicated full time employees, 2 of which are based in the townships and a further contingent of wonderful volunteers predominantly based in Cape Town, most of whom have full-time jobs. Our foster and support network is mostly based in Cape Town and surrounds.</span></span></span><br />
