    <p style ="font-family:Century Gothic;">Sterilising dogs and cats helps with managing large populations that cannot be cared for and looked after. It reduces the number of strays, the cases of animal abuse and the possibility of unwanted diseases (animals and people). Sterilisation drives benefit the people and the animals in the community.<br />
    <br/>  
To date, we have sterilised over 2500 animals, as well as assisted other surrounding towns with medical assistance and manpower for sterilisation drives.<br />
    <br />

​In Vredenburg the animals are living in atrocious conditions and are in dire need of assistance. There is a population of approximately 8000 people, with each household owning about 3 dogs that have not yet been sterilised. It is our aim to sterilise as many of these animals as possible.<br />
    <br />
